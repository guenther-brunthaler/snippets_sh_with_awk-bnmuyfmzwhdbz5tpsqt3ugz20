Automatic input radix base detection:

Without option -b or with option -b0, every argument defaults to
radix base 10 but the following argument prefixes can be used to
override the base individually:

* "0x" and "0X" selects base 16.
* "0o" and "0O" selects base 8.
* "0b" and "0B" selects base 2.
* "0r<base> and "0r<base>:" selects base <base> (<base> itself
  must be specified as a decimal number between 1 and 36)
